{"name":"Sumarkdown","tagline":"JS-based powerful markdown editor which can be embedded in html easily.","body":"### The JS-based Markdown Editor With All You Need Comes\r\nSuMarkdown is designed to be easily embedded in your html page.All you need to do is to add our one js file with several dependency plugins to your page and write several lines of javascript code. Compared to Bootstrap-Markdown, we remove some useless function and provide multi-line code and code highlight, important to pragrammers.At the same time we provide a basic theme based on bootstrap which is simple but looks nice.However, it's easy for you to change its UI as your will through CSS and other tools. \r\n\r\n###What We Provide\r\n- **a toolbar** includes most of your need--Bold,Italic,Link,Image,Code,Quote,Header,List and OrderList\r\n- **hot-keys** doing all what you can do through the toolbar\r\n- **multi-line code** can be present perfectly\r\n- **code highlight** based on different languages\r\n- **enabled tab-indent in editor**\r\n- two methods to use our editor-- Ajax load or add the theme code to your html\r\n- two modes--real-time effect presented and click button to preview\r\n- a simple theme which looks acceptable\r\n\r\n###Demo\r\n\r\n###Dependency\r\n- jQuery Framework\r\n- highlight.js\r\n- marked.js\r\n- the basic theme we provide depends on bootstrap, you can rewrite it to discard bootstrap\r\n\r\nThough you can get them easily, we provide it in the lib directory when you download SuMarkdown.\r\nIt depends on you to get the newest version or just use ours.\r\n\r\n###The Usage\r\n####Simple Way -- add elements with special class names\r\ncode example followed\r\nFirst,add our dependency files and our suMarkdown.js.\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"lib/highlight/styles/default.css\">\r\n<script src=\"lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"lib/highlight/highlight.pack.js\"></script>\r\n<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>\r\n<script src=\"lib/marked/marked.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/suMarkdown.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\nSecond, add the DOM of our editor, you can just copy the code in the /theme/basic.html file, **which is recommended by us**.You can also write it yourself. But please **don't forget the class names that begin\r\nwith su**.\r\nThen we add several lines of javascript code to our html.\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function(){\r\n            var option={\r\n                target:'.suMarkdown',\r\n                preview:true,\r\n            };\r\n            SuMarkdown(option);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nThe parameter of option will be explained later.\r\n\r\n####AJAX Load Way\r\nFirst, the dependency files as before.\r\nThen you should add a handler for the server side to send theme file.\r\nWe give an example use express.\r\n```javascript\r\napp.get('/suMarkdown/theme/basic',function(req,res){\r\n    res.sendFile(__dirname+'/public/suMarkdown/theme/basic.html');\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThen add the code below to your html.\r\n```javascript\r\nvar option={\r\n    target:'.suMarkdown',\r\n    insert:true\r\n};\r\n$(function(){\r\n    SuMarkdown(option);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIt will append our editor to the DOM element with class-name 'suMarkdown'.\r\n\r\n####Parameter Explanation\r\n\r\n| Option Name | Type | Description |\r\n|-----------------|-------|-------------------------------|\r\n|`insert`|`boolean`|`true`: ajax load way, `false` : simple way, `default`: false |\r\n|`target`|`String,DOM Element,JQuery Object`| `css selector grammar` as `String` , the element it selects will wrap our editor, `default`:`'.suMarkdown'`|\r\n|`preview`|`boolean`|`true`:the real-time effect mode,you will have a preview box along side to see the effect, `false`:the button-preview mode, you will have to click the preview button to see the effect|\r\n|`textHeight`|`String`|Set the height of text area and preview area of our editor, you can use `\"500px\"`,`\"20%\"` and so on, or you can set this just through css outside|\r\n|`clean`|`boolean`|`true`:the editor will be initialized simply in UI, `false`:will not, `default`:true, we recommend not to change it|\r\n|`CSS`|`Object`|initialize the editor as your will|\r\n|`textCss`|`Object`|more detaily initialize the CSS of text area of editor as your will |\r\n\r\n###Other Examples\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
